Ask me one question at a time so we can develop a thorough, step-by-step spec for this idea. Each question should build on my previous answers, and our end goal is to have a detailed specification I can hand off to a engineer. Let's do this iteratively and dig into every relevant detail. Remember, only one question at a time.

Here's the idea: An LLM AI that works as a review agent for github pull requests. The AI has Tech Lead level expertise and also has a RAG knowledge base of the entire repository (and potentially other repositories and other documents). It can review code using a given set of directives in a .md file. It can review github pull requests using the github API by adding comments that highlight code segments and also give code change suggestions within the github pull request page

Output would be: spec.md
