# AI-Powered GitHub Pull Request Review Agent Specification

## Overview
This document outlines the specifications for an AI-powered GitHub pull request review agent. The agent will act as a Tech Lead-level reviewer, leveraging a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) knowledge base and a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed feedback on pull requests.

---

## Core Features

### Focus Areas
The AI will prioritize the following areas during its review:
1. **Performance issues and code optimization** (highest priority).
2. **Potential bugs and inconsistencies in data**.
3. **Code quality**.
4. **Adherence to coding standards**.
5. **SQL query optimization**.

### Review Scope
- **Comprehensive Review**: The AI will analyze the pull request in the context of the entire repository.
- **Diff Review**: The AI will focus on specific changes introduced in the pull request.

### Feedback Mechanism
- **Inline Comments**: The AI will add comments directly on the code in the diff.
- **Code Suggestions**: The AI will suggest specific code changes where applicable.

### Directives and Guidelines
- The AI will follow a set of directives and coding guidelines provided as `.md` files within the repository.
- These files will be specified through a YAML configuration file.

---

## Configuration

### YAML Configuration File
The YAML file will control the AI's behavior and include:
- **Directives**: Paths to `.md` files containing coding standards and guidelines.
- **Exclusions**: Files, directories, or types of changes to exclude from the review.
- **LLM Parameters**:
  - `temperature`
  - `max_tokens`
  - `top_p`
  - `frequency_penalty`
  - `presence_penalty`
  - `context_window_size`
  - `model_name`
  - `batch_size`
  - `retry_attempts`
  - `timeout`
  - `log_level`
  - `repository_context_limit`
  - `diff_context_limit`
  - `suggestion_limit`
- **LLM Backend**: Specify the LLM backend (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or local models) and provide tokens for each backend.
- **Update Frequency**: Adjustable parameter for periodic updates to the RAG knowledge base (default: weekly).

---

## Workflow

### Triggering the AI
- The AI will be triggered through a GitHub Actions workflow.
- By default, it will run for all pull requests, but the behavior can be adjusted via the workflow YAML file.

### Incremental Processing
- The AI will process files incrementally to handle large repositories or pull requests efficiently.

### Retry Mechanism
- If the selected LLM backend fails:
  1. Retry with a different LLM backend (if configured).
  2. Retry with a reduced context window size.
  3. Log the failure if all retries fail.

### Logging
- The AI will generate logs for each pull request, including:
  - General PR information (e.g., author, triggerer of the LLM API).
  - Analyzed files.
  - Skipped files.
  - Errors encountered.
- Logs will be stored alongside the pull request or in a designated location (to be determined).

### Notifications
- Critical issues (e.g., configuration errors or LLM failures) will trigger an email notification.

---

## Knowledge Base

### Multi-Repository Support
- The AI will use a RAG-based knowledge system to reference multiple repositories.
- Repositories will be integrated via the YAML configuration file.

### Update Mechanism
- The knowledge base will be updated periodically (default: weekly) with an adjustable frequency.

---

## Additional Features

### Dry-Run Mode
- A dry-run mode will validate the configuration before production use:
  - Check YAML syntax and required parameters.
  - Test connectivity to LLM backends.
  - Verify repository access.

### Consistent Style
- The AI will provide feedback in a single, consistent style using English.

---

## Security
- The AI will have **read-only access** to the repository.
- No additional security measures (e.g., encryption or restricted file access) are required.

---

## Out of Scope
- Effectiveness tracking (e.g., accepted/rejected suggestions).
- Localization or customization of feedback style.
- Configuration versioning.

---

## Future Considerations
- Suggestions for architecture and deployment:
  - **RAG Knowledge Base**: Use a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) to store embeddings of repository files for efficient retrieval.
  - **LLM Deployment**: Support cloud-based LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, Azure OpenAI) and local models (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers) for flexibility.
  - **Logs Storage**: Store logs in a centralized location (e.g., S3 bucket, database) for easy access and analysis.

## Conclusion
This specification provides a detailed blueprint for developing the AI-powered GitHub pull request review agent. The outlined features and configurations ensure flexibility, scalability, and efficiency in reviewing pull requests.
