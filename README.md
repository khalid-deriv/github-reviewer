# GitHub Pull Request Review Agent

This project implements an AI-powered GitHub pull request review agent. Acting as a Tech Lead-level reviewer, the agent leverages a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) knowledge base and a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide detailed feedback on pull requests.

## Features
- Performance and code optimization analysis.
- Detection of potential bugs and inconsistencies.
- Adherence to coding standards.
- SQL query optimization.
- Comprehensive and diff-based reviews.

## Folder Structure
- `config/`: Contains configuration files for the agent.
- `logs/`: Stores log files generated during pull request reviews.
- `core/`: Houses the main functionality and logic of the project.

## Getting Started
Refer to the `spec.md` file for detailed specifications and setup instructions.
